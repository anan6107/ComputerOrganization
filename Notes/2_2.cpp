Requires explicitly parallel programming
  compare with explicitly parallel programming
    hardware executes multiple instructions at once
    hidden from the programmer
  hard to do
    programming for performance
    load balancing
    optimizing comm and synch

Pipelining -> favors RISC
Compilers make a big diff
Localize mem accesses to speed up

Reduced instructions -> favors CISC

HP1000 E Series
  |-> What he started on. Absolutely ancient

//Definitions
Datapath: performs operations on data
  ALU
Control: sequences datapath, memory, ...
  decode the opcode to determine datapath (?)
Cache memory: small fast SRAM memory

Vacuum Tube: 1951
Transistor: 1965
Integrated Circuit: 1975
