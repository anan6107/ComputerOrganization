Eight Great Ideas in Computer Architecture
  - design for Moores Law
    -hardware changes tend to address this one
  - Use Abstraction to simplify design
    -addingn loops/variables into assembly
  - Make the Common Case Fast
  - Performance via parallelism
  - Performance via Pipelining
  - Performance via prediction
  - Hierarchy of memories
  - Dependability via redundancy

Performance
  -computer designer Goals
    -minimize execution time
      sec/clock cycle (cc) x cc/instruction x inst/function = sec/fnct
      -improve tech/minimize cc/impove inst efficiency
